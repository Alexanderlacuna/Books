* R/QTL2 developer guide
r-qtl2 is a reimplementation for the r-qtl,
qtl means quantitave trait loci
location in chromosomes  (genetic loci)
that influence trait in an individual
QTL mapping - statistical method
to map the trait to the genetic loci in a chromosome
In this document, we'll describe the technical details of interests to those
interested in contributing the rqtl package
This package (rqtl-2) can be divided into three sectionsa/aspects


** A hidden Markov model (HMM)
this it calculate QTL genotype probabities given genetic marker data
and to estimate genetic maps. This is coded in C++.
Each possiblc cross type is  class inherited from the class QTLCROSS
We're using Rcpp to connect from R to C++

Question:
- [] what is genetic marker data?
- [] what is a genetic map
  
** Linear regression
This is for QTL Mapping  by HAley-Knott regression.
We're using RcppEigen and the Eigen Linerar algebra libary

** Linear Mixed models

for handling varying relatedness among individuals. again
using RcppEigen and the *Eigen linear algebra library*


We are redefining the basic data structures to be more general
(to handl more complex crosses, such as the collaborative
cros, magic lines  and Diversity outcross) ad to incorporate
more information such as annotations of the phenotypes
(for example with gene expression data, the gene
indetifiers, physical locations of genes and the
tissue that was measured)

We are also defining th input data file format
